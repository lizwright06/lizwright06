Hi, Iâ€™m @lizwright06

Hi! I'm Liz, a current Software Engineering university student!
While my previous projects are in Java, I know a little bit of Python and I'm currently learning C. I can also pick up the syntax for new languages fairly easily, so I'm always looking to upskill with new ones.

Check out my previous projects repository to see my work up until now, and check back soon to see what I'll do in university!
